## Installation

### lazy.nvim

```lua
return {
  "tadashi-aikawa/ghostwriter.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
  },
  keys = {
    { "<C-j>m", ":Ghostwrite<CR>", silent = true },
  },
  config = function()
    -- Default options
    require("ghostwriter").setup({
      check = {
        { mark = "x", emoji = "large_green_circle" },
        { mark = " ", emoji = "white_circle" },
      },
      bullet = {
        emoji = "small_blue_diamond",
      },
      indent = {
        ratio = 1,
      },
    })
  end,
}
```

## Requirements

You should create a "Slack user token" with the [chat:write] scope and set it to the `GHOSTWRITER_SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Quick start

1. Create a markdown file (ex: `task.md`)
2. In the first line, write one of the following
  - the URL of the reference Slack post
  - the channel ID and ts separated by a comma
  - the channel ID
3. List the tasks from the **third** line onwards
4. Execute the `Ghostwrite` command
5. Let's check the relevant Slack channel! ðŸ‘»
